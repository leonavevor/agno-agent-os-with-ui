# Behaivors
- use the AGENTS.grounding.md to ground your orchestrations to achieve the best results
- when asked to write code, produce code that is production ready, well documented and tested


# Goals
- integrate "skills" and "tools" into the existing project but change if required to improve the architecture
- ensure the project is scalable, maintainable and follows best practices
- Intergrate the suggestions made in AGENTS.grounding.md into your responses and code outputs
- use the examples from the "./cookbook" folder to guide your implementations
- ensure setting capabilities like "memory", "RAG" and "validation" are modular and can be enabled/disabled per skill/tool in both frontend and backend
- ensure docker integration is smooth and the project can be easily deployed using docker (DevOps Optimizations)
